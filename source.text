Chapter 1 - Naming Islands & Other Lands

An island is a kind of room.

Troy is an island. "The wreck of a once-mighty city. The remains of the city are on a hill by the mouth of the river Scamander. Double defensive walls ring the city, covered in scorch marks and badly damaged. There are bodies piled against the walls. Bronze arrowheads and broken spear-shafts litter the ground. Fires smoulder in the streets."

Djerba is an island. "Lizards dangle from boughs of trees. There are people sprawled on the ground, as though they have been felled by a blow, but there are no traces of a battle, and no one is wounded. Something is missing here, perhaps someone, but no one is mourning. No one pays attention to you as you walk toward a shrine wth a cold brazier and a heap of clay offering-figures."

Aeaea is an island. "Rosemary bushes as tall as a man. The air is full of scarlet and onyx bees, twice as big as they should be. A dozen ivory dice are lying in a bed of dark-green moss. Blindfolded herms flank a path from the shore into a grove of pine trees. There is a small stone house with yellow smoke emerging. Wolves, lions, and deer wander the island, nudging each other companiably. When they notice you, they go still."

Thrinacia is an island. "Cows wander the island, their horns curving fantastically. A man is drinking pale yellow juice from a golden cup. He looks at you, turns his cup over, and pours his drink on the ground." 

Ogygia is an island. "Apple trees are growing with white blossoms and blood-red fruit at the same time. Cypress trees reach to the sky. Birds, eerily silent, are flapping their wings; there are no birdâ€™s-nests, but fallen feathers carpet the ground."

Scheria is an island. "A small table is laden with rhytons full of barley beer. A barbarian's drink, but you would not reject it after your journey. White fabric is draped over bushes. Nearby, boys wrestle and throw javelins at a practice target, bright-eyed and laughing."

Ithaka is an island. "The hills are made of pale cream and purple-gray stone. A woman is carrying a bronze-and-gold bowl with lead loom-weights in it. A woman is carrying a basket full of unwashed wool, greasy and full of grassy debris. A goat with yellow eyes follows you."

The Open Ocean is a room. "The water is dark, the color of unwatered wine. A raft is floating on the ocean. A bird is sitting on the raft. Seaweed is drying on the raft. The wind is coming from the north and smells of snow."

The Underworld is a room. "The air smells of lilies and blood. It is always just past sunset. There is a three-headed dog, spotted like a hyena, lying nearby. A iron double axe-head with dried blood on its blade is sticking out of the rocky ground."

	repeat with unused running through the list of stabilized islands:
		add Ithaka to Elsewhere;
	sort Elsewhere in random order;
	let next be entry 1 of Elsewhere;
	move the player to next.

To stabilize (i - an island):

To say understandable directions:
	let L be the list of stabilized islands;
	remove location from L;
	if L is empty:
		say "The stars overhead are familiar once again, but you don't know where anything else is.";

		let D be a list of text;
		repeat with i running through L:
			add "[i] is to [the best route from location to i]" to D;
